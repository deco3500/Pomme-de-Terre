      <h4>Family of Nicole Tucker, who died in horror smash at Bedford Park, break silence and pay tribute to her</h4>
      <p class="tag">Jordann a Shriever (The Advertiser), 20.10.2016 at 6:58am</p>
	  <div id = "space"><br><!-- Spacer Div --></div>
	  
      <p class="text_column"><b>DEVOTED mother-of-two Nicole Tucker always put her children first.</b></p>
	  
      <p class="text_column">
	    She spent countless hours supporting her children and driving them to their various sporting endeavours or friends’ houses to give them the best life possible.
	    <br><br>It was when she was returning from dropping her daughter at a friend’s house that tragedy struck.
	    <br><br>The 48-year-old was driving home to the Adelaide suburb of Panorama after dropping Gemma, 16, off in Flagstaff Hill when she was killed in a crash involving a stolen ute that was allegedly being driven at more than 160km/h by a 15-year-old boy, with a 17-year-old boy in the passenger seat.
	    <br><br>In an incident that shocked the state, Mrs Tucker was waiting to turn on to South Rd from the Southern Expressway at Bedford Park on October 6 when the ute slammed into her car, causing it to burst into flames.
	    <br><br>Her grieving husband Brett Tucker, 48, and her brother Kent Thiele, 51, have broken their public silence to talk of their struggle and pay tribute to the loving mother, describing her as caring, selfless and the glue which bound their families and friends together.
	    <br><br>Her grieving husband Brett Tucker, 48, and her brother Kent Thiele, 51, have broken their public silence to talk of their struggle and pay tribute to the loving mother, describing her as caring, selfless and the glue which bound their families and friends together.
	    <br><br>“She was an extremely caring mother,” Mr Tucker said. “She put everyone else first and herself a long way second.”
	    <br><br>“She was very selfless,” Mr Thiele said.
	    <br><br>“She would do things like run her kids around endlessly to things — to the point where I couldn’t even believe at times how much she would do.”
	    <br><br>She would always watch her children, Gemma and Corey, 18, play sports and get involved with coaching, managing or scoring.
	    <br><br>“She would always sit there and watch them,” Mr Tucker said.
	    <br><br>“She was loving and supportive of the kids in everything they did. No matter how good or bad they were at something she would always support them. She was very encouraging, supportive and protective as well.”
	    <br><br>He remembered his wife of more than 20 years as outgoing, bubbly and caring.
	    <br><br>Mr Thiele, who is also president of Tennis SA, said his sister had always kept fit, starting ballet as a youngster before turning to netball at 12 and tennis at 15.
	    <br><br>“I remember going to watch her a lot playing netball in the cold rain in winter and thinking ‘this is ridiculous’ and she’d be out there crunching her fingers on the cold ball. She loved it,” he said.
	    <br><br>She was still playing competitive tennis for their childhood club, Colonel Light West, and played social netball as often as three nights a week.
	    <br><br>She also organised social events for their close friends whose families regularly travelled together.
	    <br><br>“She was the connector, she organised everything ... she went out of her way to do that, it was never too much trouble for her,” Mr Thiele said.
	    <br><br>Growing up, he said his sister easily made friends.
	    <br><br>“She was always cheeky, a cheeky rascal. We got along really well and socialised together a lot growing up in our teens.”
	    <br><br>Mrs Tucker was also an avid reader and lover of the family’s two pet dogs a terrier cross named Benni and an American staffy cross named Roxy — whom she walked every day.
	    <br><br>Mr Tucker said the couple’s children were finding it difficult to come to terms with the loss of their loving mother.
	    <br><br>“It’s going to be a struggle for a long time,” he said.
	    <br><br>Mrs Tucker’s family said they were “horrified by the circumstances” of her death, but remain steadfast in cherishing the happier times they shared.
	    <br><br>“We want to focus on the positives of Nicole’s life,” Mr Thiele said.
	    <br><br>The two boys charged over the crash have been remanded in detention to next appear in court in November.
