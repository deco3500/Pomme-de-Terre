# Pomme-de-Terre

# Introduction
The use of smartphones in Australia is continuing to increase and every day users are actively checking their social media applications. These applications are beginning to represent primary resources for daily news. However they lead to a noticeable gap between news broadcasters/journalists and audiences. The journalism industry needs to keep pace with the change and find a new way to deliver their news and increase their audience. As a result, the team plans to design and implement an innovative way to present the news. The proposed project will be a mobile application, “JournaListen” which intends to utilize the same domain and concepts that the social media applications have adopted. 

# Concept
After receiving numerous feedback on the scale of our project and its various functionality, the group has divided the concept into two parts:

  1. **The Prototype** - the main concept and what the group believes we can realistically deliver into a well design prototype that supports the problem space.
  2. **Future Functionality** - additional functionality that will enhance the user’s experience of the mobile application.

### The Prototype
The proposed technology intends to stream video or voice recordings of local journalists as a new way of sharing breaking news with an audience, rather than through typed articles. The project aims to facilitate the delivery of news to persons who are unable to visually read news articles. This includes people with vision impairment, auditory learners, or people who are participating in activities that do not allow them to read or use their hands to interact with a mobile device, such as whilst driving or working. 

The application will have two interfaces - one for journalists, and one for the users. In order to begin publishing voice records, journalists will need to create an account and have it authenticated using location services, a captcha code, and an email verification. This will ensure that the content being uploaded is by a human, and they are reporting on stories from a location that is nearby to them. Journalists will then be able to upload voice or video recordings of the news topics they want to deliver to a refined target audience. They must select the category, if it is breaking news, and where it is happening. These audio files will be stored using cloud storage.

In order for the public to use the application, they will need to register for an account with a username, email address, and password. Once users have access, they will be able to select the area they wish to hear news from, the topics they would like to receive notifications about, and subscribe to a particular journalist they are interested in. 

### Future Functionality
Additional functionality includes the use of audible notifications and voice commands. Once the news recordings have been uploaded to the application, users who are subscribed to receive updates will receive an audible notification with a computerised voice stating one of the following prompts:

* “Breaking news alert”
* “A new recording has been uploaded for a topic you are following”
* “A new recording has been uploaded for your local area”

Users will then be able to interact with the application by responding with either “listen” or “ignore” after the automated prompts have ceased. If they choose to listen, they will be read the headline, then prompted one more time to either listen or ignore. After listening to the recording, the user will be able to use their voice to command the application to share the story to Facebook, Twitter, or Email, however in the deliverable prototype we will focus on clickable links for this shareable content.

The idea differs from other applications as adding the records to the application is restricted to the journalists. The user can play the records as a stream not individually. The journalists are divided on the basis of their current location and their interest. The journalists have the freedom to add any record without content limitations or supervision. The users can add comments and prompt the journalists about their opinion. The journalists at the same time can interact with the users to clarify their idea.  

### Revenue
In order to generate revenue, we will be implementing a small monthly subscription based service that will consist of three types of packages to cater for our multiple user groups: 

* A basic plan where freelance journalists are able to upload a single recording per day. This will be free.
* A freelance plan where individual journalists are able to upload unlimited recordings per day.
* A series of corporate plans where broadcasters and newspapers are able to have multiple journalists who are able to make as many uploads per day as they wish.

Initially when we deploy the application, we will offer a free 30 day trial to build customer interest.  

### Feedback From Pitch

After presenting the pitch we received feedback that we believe will be beneficial to our project.

* **Will there be an option to mute the application for meetings?**

The application will incorporate a feature similar to Facebook's notification settings. The user will be given an option to mute notifications/alerts for a specified time period, for example 1 hour. 

* **Is there a reward system that will offer incentive for users to use this application rather than other mainstream news applications?** 

There will not be a monetary figure for journalists or users, however it will provide another platform for journalists to build their name and recognition, similar to free mainstream news websites. This decision was made as the group intends to target the application for users with a preference for audible content, vision impairment or performing activities such as work that prevent them from reading news articles.  It will simply provide another option for delivering the news than the current websites. 

* **How would a journalist target a specific audience?** 

The group is adopting similar principles to social media sites such as the use of hashtags and search features. The journalist would include tags when they upload their content to target specific audiences.

# Team
The team consists of the following four members who possess a variety of skillsets and interests.

|Name              |Student Number| Course Code|
|------------------|--------------|------------|
|Gima Auo          |43203305      |DECO3500    |
|Emma Gelsomino    |43203134      |DECO3500    |
|Taylor Rose       |43900330      |DECO3500    |
|Rawan Albusayli   |43851450      |DECO7350    |

### Roles and Responsibilities
After discussion amongst the team, Taylor will lead the team and manage the project. This will involve the scheduling of meetings and ensuring all tasks are on track to be completed in appropriate time frames.  Although each member will be working together to complete the project, we have additionally elected the following roles and responsibilities:

* **Rawan:** Backend of the application such as programming and prototyping.
* **Emma:** User interfaces and conducting user experience testing.
* **Gima:** Backend programming and content generation.
* **Taylor:** Application design and backend programming. 

All major decisions that impact the project will be made using the six hats method as this will encourage communication amongst all members.

### Performance Management and Conflict Resolution
The following expectations have been agreed upon by all members:

* All members should endeavour to contribute equal workload to the project.
* Individual tasks should be completed 24 hours prior to submission deadlines, to allow time for other group members to check, edit or offer suggestions.
* If a member is struggling to complete an assigned task by the deadline or to the expected standard, they should notify the group and ask for assistance. 
* Expected standards of works or goals should be agreed upon prior to commencing each task. All elements should pass a series of predetermined tests or ‘acceptance criteria’ before they can be considered complete.

Possible reasons for intervention:

* Missing multiple meetings without informing the team
* Underperformance with assigned tasks or not completing on time
* Unequal contribution to the project’s workload
* Conflict between team members

It is important that all group members are aware of the correct protocol in order to resolve conflict or performance issues. In the event that conflict arises within the group, the following steps will be taken. 

1. An informal meeting with all parties involved where the problem can be discussed. This informal setting will minimize hostility as it allows all parties to provide input and suggest solutions or possible courses of action.  
2. The team leader, unless they are the party involved in the conflict, will intervene and act as an objective third party. The third party should ask each member to explain their problems/challenges and should then suggest solutions that may be agreeable to all parties. 
3. If the conflict is still not resolved the DECO3500 staff should be notified. 

# Communication

### Meetings
The primary tool of communication will be WhatsApp and it should be checked daily to ensure all members are up to date with the project. If a member is unreachable, then the secondary methods of communication will be phone and email. 

Initially, the group has agreed to meet weekly during the Workshop session (Friday 10:00-12:00). A member must notify other group members via WhatsApp if they are not able to attend the session. Acceptable reasons for non-attendance:

* Sickness
* Work or sporting commitments
* Other emergency 

The group should provide the absent member with a summary of what was covered in the meeting and any goals or tasks to be completed in the week ahead. If it is deemed necessary by all group members an additional meeting may be scheduled on another day. 

### Google Drive
All files will be stored in a private Google Drive folder that will only be accessible to our group members. Google Drive was selected due to its excellent real-time collaboration facilitating the editing and creation of documents by multiple users, and additionally for its compatibility features. It also facilitates communication through the ability to leave comments to other group members and respond to comments. 

Folders will be used to organize the drive and the group has agreed to the following naming conventions:

* Communication
* Deliverables
* Documentation
* Resources

Files will be organised using the following naming conventions:

* Camelback notation for images, sketches, etc - ie homeButton.png
* Documentation to be submitted as TeamName_FileName - ie PommeDeTerre_Proposal
* Documentation to be submitted as a PDF unless otherwise specified 


### Other Social Platforms
Additionally, the team will be using Slack, Zenhub and GitHub in completion of this project. Each of these technologies have been selected as the group believes they will improve our communication.

* **Slack** - allows for synchronous communication on different devices. Slack is also extremely beneficial as it is able to be integrated with Google Drive Folder, Zenhub and also our GitHub.
* **Zenhub** - a project management tool which will facilitate group work, deadlines and scheduling within the group.
* **GitHub** - facilitates the ability to share source code and store issues and other documentation.
